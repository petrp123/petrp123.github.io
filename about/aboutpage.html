		<p>Chemical reactions can be put into 5 different categories: single replacements, double replacements, decomposition, synthesis, and combustion.</p>
		<p>A single displacement reaction is a chemical reaction where one reactant is exchanged for one ion of a second reactant.</p>
		<p>An example of this is A + BC = B + AC
		<p>A double replacement reaction is where two compounds react, and the positive ions and the negative ions of the two reactants switch places, forming two new compounds or products.</p>
		<p>An example of this is AB + CD = AD + CB </p>
		<p>Decomposition is the separation of a chemical compound into elements or simpler compounds it can also be defined as the exact opposite of synthesis.</p>
		<p>An example of this is AB = A + B </p>
		<p>A synthesis reaction is a type of reaction in which multiple chemicals combine to form a single product </p>
		<p>An example of this is A + B = AB </p>
		<p>A combustion reaction is a reaction where a chemical and an oxidant react to create a new substance and heat. </p>
		<p>An example of this is H2 + O2 â†’ H2O + heat </p>
		<p> these examples are the basics of all chemical reactions and just breach the surface of chemistry.</p>
